Custom ActiveRecord Validator, useful if you need to verify an age based on a date (eg: birthdate)

## Usage

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'age_validator'
```

Run:

```
bundle install
```

Then add the following to your model:

```ruby
validates :my_date_attribute, age: true
```

## Optional parameters

The age validator accepts a minimum parameter, and also a custom error message:

```ruby
validates :my_date_attribute, age: {minimum: 14, message: "Your message"}
```

## Validation outside a model

If you need to validate an age outside a model, you can do like this:

```ruby
AgeValidator.valid?(Date.today - 18.years) # boolean
```
